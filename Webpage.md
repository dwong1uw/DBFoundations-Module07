#Functions	

##Introduction
The purpose of this document is to learn about the SQL user defined function. Weâ€™ll learn about what a UDF is, when are they good to use and the differences between scalar, inline and multi-statement functions.

##SQL UDF
A user defined function (UDF) allows customization in functions to return values as a single value or as a table.  This allows a user to define their own calculations and formatting. Once a function is created, it can be reused, which is very helpful when complex codes do not have to be re-written each time. Scalar, inline and multi-statement functions are a few versions of UDFs. 

###Scalar Functions
With scalar functions, it returns a single value where schema names are required. Parameters can also be used with scalar functions.

###Inline Functions
The simplest UDF is said to be inline functions that is used as a table function and can return a single set of rows. Parameters in table functions are not as useful when it is used in scalar functions.

###Multi-Statement Functions
Similar to inline functions that returns as a table function is multi-statement function. An added capability is that multiple select statements can be performed so various sources can be used to build a customized table. Figure 1 shows some similar constraints of both scalar functions and table-valued functions (https://www.wiseowl.co.uk/blog/s347/limitations.htm) (External Site).

##Summary
We reviewed the great benefit of allowing customization through user defined functions and examples of three different types. Whether we have an output of a single value or as a table of values, UDFs provides a user more capability and flexibility in calculations and formatting. While there are still limitations to each, it is still a good tool.
